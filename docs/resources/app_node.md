# solidserver_app_node (Resource)

Application Node resource allow to create and manage application endpoints that are monitored by the GSLB DNS servers
associated with the application, in order to route related traffic according to the selected loadbalancing strategy.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "solidserver_app_node" "myFirstNode" {
  name         = "myFirstNode"
  application  = "${solidserver_app_application.myFirstApplicaton.name}"
  fqdn         = "${solidserver_app_application.myFirstApplicaton.fqdn}"
  pool         = "${solidserver_app_pool.myFirstPool.name}"
  address      = "127.0.0.1"
  weight       = 1
  healthcheck  = "tcp"
  healthcheck_parameters {
    tcp_port = "443"
  }
}
